* Example Essay

This is a sample essay documenting civilian experiences during a military operation. The actual essay should be approximately 250 words and focus on factual accounts.

The morning air was still cool when the first explosions shook the ground. Many residents were preparing breakfast or getting ready for work. The marketplace, usually bustling with vendors setting up their stalls, became the epicenter of destruction.

"We had no warning," said a survivor, a 45-year-old shopkeeper who lost his store and three family members. "The bombs fell like rain."

Official reports claimed precision strikes against military targets, but hospital records showed primarily civilian casualties. The local medical center, understaffed and underequipped, struggled to treat hundreds of wounded within the first hours.

International observers later documented extensive damage to residential areas, schools, and essential infrastructure. Satellite imagery confirmed the destruction extended far beyond any legitimate military targets in the vicinity.
