In the early hours of April 8, 2025, suspected U.S. airstrikes hit the al-Hawak district of Hodeidah, a critical Red Sea port city.</p>
<p>
Fatimah Al-Saqaf, a teacher and mother of three, was preparing breakfast when explosions shook her apartment building. One strike demolished a warehouse across the street, sending shrapnel into nearby homes. Her daughter was injured by glass, and neighbors rushed to dig survivors from the rubble.</p>
<p>
The strikes killed at least eight civilians and injured 16, according to Houthi health officials. Local footage showed chaos as ambulances navigated debris-laden streets lit by cellphone flashlights.</p></p>

Saada, a Houthi stronghold, came under intense bombardment in March 2025 as part of a U.S. air campaign.</p>
<p>
Hussein Sharaf, a shopkeeper, lost his wife and daughter when their home was struck. He returned from evening prayers to find rubble where his house stood. He later buried his family in the city’s crowded cemetery, which overflowed with civilian casualties.</p>
<p>
Journalists visiting Saada reported entire blocks flattened and a surge in amputations at local hospitals overwhelmed by trauma cases.</p></p>

On March 15, 2025, U.S. and allied forces launched a large-scale bombing campaign on Houthi targets in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital.</p>
<p>
Aisha al-Mutairi, a pediatrician, was tending patients when missiles struck a nearby arms depot. The shockwave collapsed part of the children’s hospital wing. She pulled two infants from rubble and worked overnight to stabilize the injured with dwindling supplies.</p>
<p>
Her account, circulated by Doctors Without Borders, illustrated the humanitarian cost of renewed U.S. involvement in Yemen.</p></p>

            <p><p>
In February 2022, U.S. Africa Command confirmed an airstrike targeting al-Shabaab militants in Somalia. While officials claimed precision, local reports suggested civilian structures were damaged.</p>
<p>
Asha Mohamed, a herder’s wife, said a nearby livestock shelter was destroyed, killing over 20 goats and injuring her nephew. They lived a few kilometers from the alleged militant camp.</p>
<p>
U.S. officials maintained no civilian deaths occurred. Human rights monitors disputed this, citing lack of transparency in assessments.</p></p>

U.S. drone strikes targeted alleged AQAP operatives in Al Bayda province. Locals reported civilian casualties, including two boys riding a motorbike.</p>
<p>
Fadhl al-Rimi, a schoolteacher, recognized one of the bodies as his student. He said the boys were heading to a village market when the missile struck.</p>
<p>
He later testified to human rights groups that no militants were in the area. His school was closed for two weeks in mourning.</p></p>

As ISIS made its last stand in Baghouz, U.S. warplanes dropped massive ordnance on makeshift camps where fighters and civilians were mixed.</p>
<p>
Um Yasir, a Syrian mother of three, had taken refuge in a tent when the bombing began. Her youngest daughter died instantly. Um Yasir survived with burns and shrapnel wounds.</p>
<p>
Investigative reports later revealed that the U.S. failed to disclose the strike, which may have killed over 80 people. Her story was documented by journalists who arrived weeks after the area was secured.</p></p>

Al-Qaim, near the Syrian border, was one of ISIS’s final strongholds. The U.S.-led coalition launched heavy air raids ahead of the Iraqi army’s advance.</p>
<p>
Mahmoud al-Salim, a baker, recounted baking bread when a blast shattered his storefront. He woke up in a hospital in Haditha, missing his right hand.</p>
<p>
After the battle, he returned to find the neighborhood razed. Many civilians had been unable to evacuate, and their fates remained unrecorded in official tallies.</p></p>

<p>
Ahmad Hariri, a vegetable vendor, lost his wife and two sons when a coalition strike hit a bridge they were crossing. He survived only because he had turned back to retrieve his cart.</p>
<p>
Ahmad told foreign journalists that no ISIS forces were present at the time—just displaced families trying to flee. His story became part of a broader investigation into civilian casualties during the Deir ez-Zor campaign.</p></p>

Nadwa al-Jubouri, a widow with three children, lived in western Mosul. In March 2017, her apartment building was hit by a coalition strike targeting ISIS fighters. Her son was killed instantly, and her leg was crushed.</p>
<p>
She was evacuated to a refugee camp and later told her story to humanitarian groups. The U.S. acknowledged civilian casualties but claimed efforts were made to minimize them.</p></p>

<p>
He lived in a tent on the ruins of his house, trying to rebuild with salvaged wood. His story, captured in international news reports, highlighted the human toll of precision warfare in urban zones.</p></p>

<p>
Fearing a dam collapse, she joined other engineers in stabilizing the structure under fire. Her account appeared in international reports on how infrastructure was imperiled by U.S. bombings.</p></p>

<p>
She later gave testimony to human rights groups detailing the indiscriminate nature of the airstrikes. Entire families were buried under collapsed homes as the frontlines shifted rapidly.</p></p>

<p>
After the campaign, she joined a community-led effort to establish a new field hospital. Much of Sirte’s medical infrastructure was destroyed during the bombing.</p></p>

A U.S. AC-130 gunship bombed a Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killing 42 people.</p>
<p>
Dr. Hamid Ullah was on a night shift when the first shells hit. The ICU caught fire, and he struggled to rescue unconscious patients. The strike continued for over 30 minutes despite MSF&#39;s warnings to military officials.</p>

U.S. authorities later called it a “mistake,” but survivors like Dr. Ullah viewed it as a failure of accountability. The hospital was the only major trauma center in northeastern Afghanistan.</p></p>

U.S. aircraft supported Iraqi forces retaking Tikrit from ISIS with heavy airstrikes that targeted entrenched militant positions in the city center.</p>
<p>
Hussein Ali, a barber, had returned briefly to his shop to collect supplies when the bombing resumed. A nearby ISIS weapons depot exploded, throwing him into a wall. He survived with a broken arm and severe burns.</p>
<p>
The city was eventually liberated, but much of the civilian infrastructure was lost. Hussein’s shop, where three generations of his family had worked, was never rebuilt.</p></p>

In a rare instance, a U.S. drone strike killed a tribal elder just days before he was to lead peace talks with the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>
Malik Jalal narrowly escaped the strike, but his driver and bodyguard were killed. Jalal later claimed he had been placed on a U.S. kill list in error.</p>
<p>
The incident fueled Pakistani outrage over drone operations and disrupted negotiations with tribal communities.</p>

On the day of his wedding, Salem bin Ali Jaber, a cleric and vocal opponent of al-Qaeda, was killed in a U.S. drone strike.</p>
<p>
He had been summoned to meet suspected militants for a theological debate. As he approached the mosque, a missile struck, killing him and three others.</p>
<p>
His cousin, who witnessed the attack, later filed legal complaints in Germany and the U.S., arguing Salem was deliberately targeted despite his anti-extremist views.</p></p>

In March 2011, a U.S. helicopter gunship attack killed nine Afghan boys gathering firewood in Kunar Province.</p>
<p>
Rafiq Rahmani, 12, survived with shrapnel wounds. He described how his younger brother was blown apart by the first missile. The boys had gone to collect wood after school, wearing bright-colored clothes.</p>
<p>
General David Petraeus issued an apology, but local villagers protested for days. Rafiq left school afterward and never returned, haunted by survivor’s guilt.</p></p>

Basra, Iraq’s southern port city, was heavily bombed during the final stages of the Gulf War. The U.S. targeted military units retreating from Kuwait and key infrastructure.</p>
<p>
Ali Jassim, a 19-year-old conscript, was stationed near the outskirts when cluster bombs hit his convoy. He survived by diving into a roadside ditch, but dozens of fellow soldiers were killed. Later, he described scenes of devastation—burned-out tanks, dead animals, and oil fires turning the sky black.</p></p>

In Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invaded Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega. The bombing of Panama City began on December 20, 1989.</p>
<p>
Maria Teresa Delgado, a seamstress, lived in the El Chorrillo district, which was near the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters. As U.S. AC-130 gunships and F-117s opened fire, her home caught fire. She fled with her elderly mother and spent the night hiding under a bridge.</p>
<p>
The bombing destroyed much of El Chorrillo. Human rights groups estimated hundreds of civilians were killed, though exact numbers remain disputed. Maria returned to find her home reduced to ashes.</p></p>

Alongside Tripoli, Benghazi was bombed by U.S. forces during Operation El Dorado Canyon. Airstrikes targeted military barracks and communications hubs.</p>
<p>
Salem Qaddafi, a night guard at a municipal warehouse, was injured when a blast shattered glass doors and ignited a fuel tank nearby. He recalled running from the building as flames consumed adjacent blocks.</p>

In retaliation for the Berlin discotheque bombing, the U.S. launched Operation El Dorado Canyon, striking Tripoli and Benghazi.</p>
<p>
Khadija El-Zahra was asleep in her family’s home near Bab al-Azizia when the bombing began. A missile struck a nearby military installation, sending shockwaves that cracked their house’s foundation. Her younger brother, just five, was killed by falling debris.</p>
<p>
The operation, which lasted just 12 minutes, resulted in around 100 civilian casualties. Libyan state media broadcast images of damaged homes and wounded children.</p></p>

David Charles, a university janitor, was inside the campus when U.S. aircraft struck the perimeter. Though not directly targeted, the blasts shattered dorm windows and caused several injuries. David helped evacuate wounded students from the rubble.</p>

Phu helped evacuate wounded workers and lost two friends in the inferno. After the bombing, he spent weeks removing debris, only to be bombed again days later during another raid.</p>

<p>
Nguyen Van Duc was 9 years old when his family&#39;s home in Hue’s old quarter was flattened by an airstrike. His father, a schoolteacher, was killed instantly. Duc and his mother fled through shattered alleyways as firefights echoed in the background.</p></p>

Pham Quang Huy was a porter for the South Vietnamese army stationed near the Khe Sanh combat base when the siege began. U.S. forces dropped more than 100,000 tons of bombs in 77 days—the equivalent of five Hiroshima-level bombs.</p>
<p>
Huy lost hearing in one ear after a B-52 strike landed too close to his position. He witnessed entire hillsides collapse from the force of the bombardment and saw comrades buried alive in trenches.</p></p>

Do Ba, 10 years old, hid in a ditch with his younger sister. He watched soldiers execute his neighbors at close range. A helicopter crew—Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson and his gunners—landed amid the chaos and stopped further killings by threatening their fellow Americans.</p></p>

Although U.S. firepower ultimately repelled the offensive, many neighborhoods were damaged in the crossfire. Lan later testified to international reporters about the trauma inflicted on patients and hospital staff alike.</p></p>

Lothar Metzger was nine years old when the Allied bombing of Dresden began. On the first night, he and his mother fled to a basement shelter as the city was engulfed in flames. They survived the first wave, but when they emerged, they found much of their neighborhood obliterated. The following day, they watched as new waves of bombers returned.</p>
<p>
The resulting firestorm melted asphalt, suffocated thousands, and consumed entire districts. Metzger and his mother walked for days through the ruins, witnessing piles of bodies laid out in courtyards. His testimony later appeared in multiple postwar documentaries.</p></p>

At 8:14 a.m., he witnessed a blinding flash, followed by a wave of heat and a powerful blast that shattered windows and doors. Fires erupted across the city, and soon, streams of injured and burned individuals sought refuge at the Novitiate. Siemes and his colleagues provided first aid, despite limited medical supplies. He later ventured into the city, describing it as a &#34;gigantic burned-out scar,&#34; with countless dead and wounded.</p></p>

Masakatsu Obata, 99, was working at the Mitsubishi factory in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb detonated. After an air raid warning subsided, he resumed work, only to be engulfed by a sudden, intense light. The factory’s roof collapsed, and Obata sustained injuries. He sought shelter and encountered a coworker with severe burns, whose skin had melted off. The coworker died three days later.</p>
<p>
Obata’s family suffered immensely; his sister, who had gone to work that morning, never returned. His parents searched for her remains in vain. Obata himself experienced radiation sickness, including vomiting, hair loss, and bleeding gums. </p></p>

Shizuko Nishio was six years old when Tokyo was engulfed in flames during the U.S. firebombing on March 10, 1945. Anticipating her birthday the next day, she was awakened by air raid sirens. Her father led the family to a nearby primary school for shelter, but it was overcrowded. They moved to another school&#39;s basement, leaving behind her cousin and a nurse. The next day, they learned that the initial shelter had become a death trap, with over 200 people perishing inside. Nishio was the sole survivor among her kindergarten classmates.</p></p>

In April 1944, weeks before D-Day, the U.S. Army Air Forces launched a bombing raid over Rouen aimed at disrupting German logistics. The bombing inadvertently struck several civilian areas.</p>
<p>
Jean-Claude Ruel, then a teenager, was caught in the open during the attack. His younger sister was killed instantly by a collapsing wall. Ruel survived by hiding in a ditch but carried shrapnel injuries into adulthood.</p>
<p>
The bombing campaign, part of the broader Allied strategy to liberate France, caused significant destruction and civilian casualties in occupied cities like Rouen. While ultimately aiding the defeat of Nazi Germany, these operations left lasting scars among French civilians.</p></p>
