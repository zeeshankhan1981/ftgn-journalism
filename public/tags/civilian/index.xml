&lt;p>Fatimah Al-Saqaf, a teacher and mother of three, was preparing breakfast when explosions shook her apartment building. One strike demolished a warehouse across the street, sending shrapnel into nearby homes. Her daughter was injured by glass, and neighbors rushed to dig survivors from the rubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The strikes killed at least eight civilians and injured 16, according to Houthi health officials. Local footage showed chaos as ambulances navigated debris-laden streets lit by cellphone flashlights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>45 Sanaa 2025</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/51-43-saada-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/51-43-saada-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Saada, a Houthi stronghold, came under intense bombardment in March 2025 as part of a U.S. air campaign.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Investigative reports later revealed that the U.S. failed to disclose the strike, which may have killed over 80 people. Her story was documented by journalists who arrived weeks after the area was secured.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>06 Baghouz 2019</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/46-47-tabqa-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/46-47-tabqa-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>The U.S. provided air cover during the Syrian Democratic Forces’ offensive to capture Tabqa from ISIS. Airstrikes were frequent in the lead-up to the dam’s capture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nisreen al-Taha, an engineer, was working on a maintenance team at the Euphrates Dam. A strike hit an outer facility, killing several coworkers and damaging key electrical controls.&lt;/p>

The U.S.-led coalition launched heavy air raids ahead of the Iraqi army’s advance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mahmoud al-Salim, a baker, recounted baking bread when a blast shattered his storefront. He woke up in a hospital in Haditha, missing his right hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the battle, he returned to find the neighborhood razed. Many civilians had been unable to evacuate, and their fates remained unrecorded in official tallies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>34 Mosul 2017</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/43-11-deir-ez-zor-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/43-11-deir-ez-zor-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the Syrian government and U.S.-backed forces closed in on ISIS in Deir ez-Zor, the city was heavily bombarded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ahmad Hariri, a vegetable vendor, lost his wife and two sons when a coalition strike hit a bridge they were crossing. He survived only because he had turned back to retrieve his cart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ahmad told foreign journalists that no ISIS forces were present at the time—just displaced families trying to flee. His story became part of a broader investigation into civilian casualties during the Deir ez-Zor campaign.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>41 Raqqa 2017</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/44-34-mosul-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/44-34-mosul-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>The U.S.-backed campaign to liberate Mosul from ISIS involved extensive airstrikes from late 2016 to mid-2017.

&lt;p>Faisal Hamoud, a carpenter, returned to Raqqa after the fighting ended. His home was destroyed and four of his neighbors had died in a strike meant for an ISIS commander.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He lived in a tent on the ruins of his house, trying to rebuild with salvaged wood. His story, captured in international news reports, highlighted the human toll of precision warfare in urban zones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>02 Al Qaim 2017</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/41-46-sirte-2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/41-46-sirte-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the campaign to oust ISIS from Sirte, U.S. aircraft carried out over 500 airstrikes between August and December 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Salwa Ben Gassem, a midwife, was caught in the crossfire when an airstrike hit a building two doors from her clinic. The shockwave ruptured her eardrum and injured a newborn baby she was helping deliver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the campaign, she joined a community-led effort to establish a new field hospital. Much of Sirte’s medical infrastructure was destroyed during the bombing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>46 Sirte 2016</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/40-30-manbij-2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/40-30-manbij-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>Manbij was the site of intense U.S.-led coalition bombing during the campaign to expel ISIS from northern Syria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rasha Mahfouz, a teacher, remained in the city to care for her ill father. One afternoon, a bomb struck a residential block next to their home. Her father was killed by falling debris, and Rasha sustained a head injury.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She later gave testimony to human rights groups detailing the indiscriminate nature of the airstrikes. Entire families were buried under collapsed homes as the frontlines shifted rapidly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30 Manbij 2016</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/39-48-tikrit-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/39-48-tikrit-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>U.S. aircraft supported Iraqi forces retaking Tikrit from ISIS with heavy airstrikes that targeted entrenched militant positions in the city center.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hussein Ali, a barber, had returned briefly to his shop to collect supplies when the bombing resumed. A nearby ISIS weapons depot exploded, throwing him into a wall. He survived with a broken arm and severe burns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The city was eventually liberated, but much of the civilian infrastructure was lost. Hussein’s shop, where three generations of his family had worked, was never rebuilt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>48 Tikrit 2015</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/38-29-kunduz-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/38-29-kunduz-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>A U.S. AC-130 gunship bombed a Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killing 42 people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr. Hamid Ullah was on a night shift when the first shells hit. The ICU caught fire, and he struggled to rescue unconscious patients. The strike continued for over 30 minutes despite MSF&amp;rsquo;s warnings to military officials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. authorities later called it a “mistake,” but survivors like Dr. Ullah viewed it as a failure of accountability. The hospital was the only major trauma center in northeastern Afghanistan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>29 Kunduz 2015</title><link>https://torchscribe.com/essays/37-37-north-waziristan-2013/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://torchscribe.com/essays/37-37-north-waziristan-2013/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a rare instance, a U.S. drone strike killed a tribal elder just days before he was to lead peace talks with the Pakistani government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malik Jalal narrowly escaped the strike, but his driver and bodyguard were killed. Jalal later claimed he had been placed on a U.S. kill list in error.&lt;/p>
