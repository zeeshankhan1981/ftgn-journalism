The U.S. provided air cover during the Syrian Democratic Forces’ offensive to capture Tabqa from ISIS. Airstrikes were frequent in the lead-up to the dam’s capture.

Nisreen al-Taha, an engineer, was working on a maintenance team at the Euphrates Dam. A strike hit an outer facility, killing several coworkers and damaging key electrical controls.

Fearing a dam collapse, she joined other engineers in stabilizing the structure under fire. Her account appeared in international reports on how infrastructure was imperiled by U.S. bombings.
