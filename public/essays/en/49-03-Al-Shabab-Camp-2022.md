In February 2022, U.S. Africa Command confirmed an airstrike targeting al-Shabaab militants in Somalia. While officials claimed precision, local reports suggested civilian structures were damaged.

Asha Mohamed, a herderâ€™s wife, said a nearby livestock shelter was destroyed, killing over 20 goats and injuring her nephew. They lived a few kilometers from the alleged militant camp.

U.S. officials maintained no civilian deaths occurred. Human rights monitors disputed this, citing lack of transparency in assessments.
