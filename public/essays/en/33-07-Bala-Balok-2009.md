On May 4, 2009, U.S. airstrikes in Bala Baluk District, Farah Province, killed over 140 civilians according to Afghan officials.

Haji Nader Khan, a village elder, lost his daughter and three grandchildren when their home was obliterated. The villageâ€™s mud-brick houses offered no protection against 2,000-pound bombs.

He later testified to international media about the mass graves hastily dug to bury victims. The Pentagon acknowledged civilian casualties but disputed the scale.
