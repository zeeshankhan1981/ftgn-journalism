During NATOâ€™s bombing of Yugoslavia, led by the U.S., Belgrade faced weeks of strikes targeting infrastructure and media centers.

Jelena Matic, a TV technician, was working at Radio Television Serbia when the building was hit by a NATO missile. Sixteen of her colleagues were killed. She was buried under rubble for hours before being rescued.

The attack drew controversy, as critics argued it violated international law by targeting civilian broadcasters. Matic suffered permanent injuries and never returned to the studio.
