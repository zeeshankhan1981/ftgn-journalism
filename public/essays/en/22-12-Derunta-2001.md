The U.S. targeted the Derunta training complex in the early days of its air campaign in Afghanistan.

Hakim Noor, a teenager at the time, lived in a nearby farming village. A misfired bomb struck a field instead of the training camp, killing several farmhands harvesting wheat.

His father, who worked those fields for decades, helped bury the victims in a hillside cemetery. Hakim later moved to Jalalabad, never returning to farm again.
