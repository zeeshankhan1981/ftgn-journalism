As the Syrian government and U.S.-backed forces closed in on ISIS in Deir ez-Zor, the city was heavily bombarded.

Ahmad Hariri, a vegetable vendor, lost his wife and two sons when a coalition strike hit a bridge they were crossing. He survived only because he had turned back to retrieve his cart.

Ahmad told foreign journalists that no ISIS forces were present at the timeâ€”just displaced families trying to flee. His story became part of a broader investigation into civilian casualties during the Deir ez-Zor campaign.
