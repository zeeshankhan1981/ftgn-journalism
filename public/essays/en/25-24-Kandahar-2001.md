As the Taliban’s spiritual capital, Kandahar was heavily bombed in late 2001. Key facilities, including mosques and Red Crescent clinics, were damaged.

Fatima Achakzai, a schoolteacher, was inside a girls' school when a bomb struck nearby. Windows shattered and debris injured several students. Her classroom ceiling collapsed, but she shielded a child from falling rubble.

After the Taliban fled, she reopened classes in tents. She became an advocate for girls' education despite trauma and instability.
