# Manbij, Syria â€“ 2016

Manbij was the site of intense U.S.-led coalition bombing during the campaign to expel ISIS from northern Syria.

Rasha Mahfouz, a teacher, remained in the city to care for her ill father. One afternoon, a bomb struck a residential block next to their home. Her father was killed by falling debris, and Rasha sustained a head injury.

She later gave testimony to human rights groups detailing the indiscriminate nature of the airstrikes. Entire families were buried under collapsed homes as the frontlines shifted rapidly.
