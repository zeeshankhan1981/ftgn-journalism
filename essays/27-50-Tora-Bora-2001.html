<h1>50 Tora Bora 2001</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2001</em></p>
<p># Tora Bora, Afghanistan – December 2001</p>
<p>In December 2001, the U.S. launched an intense bombardment of Tora Bora, a mountainous area where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding.</p>
<p>Abdul Ghafar, a goat herder, lived on the lower slopes when the air campaign began. Fearing for his family, he fled with his wife and three children into nearby caves. They survived on dried fruit and melted snow for five days.</p>
<p>Though the strikes failed to capture bin Laden, they displaced thousands of families like Ghafar’s. His livestock were lost, and his home was destroyed in the bombings.</p>
