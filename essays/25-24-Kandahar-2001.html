<h1>24 Kandahar 2001</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2001</em></p>
<p># Kandahar, Afghanistan – December 2001</p>
<p>As the Taliban’s spiritual capital, Kandahar was heavily bombed in late 2001. Key facilities, including mosques and Red Crescent clinics, were damaged.</p>
<p>Fatima Achakzai, a schoolteacher, was inside a girls' school when a bomb struck nearby. Windows shattered and debris injured several students. Her classroom ceiling collapsed, but she shielded a child from falling rubble.</p>
<p>After the Taliban fled, she reopened classes in tents. She became an advocate for girls' education despite trauma and instability.</p>
