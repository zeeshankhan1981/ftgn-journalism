<h1>48 Tikrit 2015</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2015</em></p>
<p># Tikrit, Iraq – March 2015</p>
<p>U.S. aircraft supported Iraqi forces retaking Tikrit from ISIS with heavy airstrikes that targeted entrenched militant positions in the city center.</p>
<p>Hussein Ali, a barber, had returned briefly to his shop to collect supplies when the bombing resumed. A nearby ISIS weapons depot exploded, throwing him into a wall. He survived with a broken arm and severe burns.</p>
<p>The city was eventually liberated, but much of the civilian infrastructure was lost. Hussein’s shop, where three generations of his family had worked, was never rebuilt.</p>
