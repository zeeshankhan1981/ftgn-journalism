# Sirte, Libya – 2016

During the campaign to oust ISIS from Sirte, U.S. aircraft carried out over 500 airstrikes between August and December 2016.

Salwa Ben Gassem, a midwife, was caught in the crossfire when an airstrike hit a building two doors from her clinic. The shockwave ruptured her eardrum and injured a newborn baby she was helping deliver.

After the campaign, she joined a community-led effort to establish a new field hospital. Much of Sirte’s medical infrastructure was destroyed during the bombing.
