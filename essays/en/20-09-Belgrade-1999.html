  <article><p># Belgrade, Serbia – 1999</p>
<p>During NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia, led by the U.S., Belgrade faced weeks of strikes targeting infrastructure and media centers.</p>
<p>Jelena Matic, a TV technician, was working at Radio Television Serbia when the building was hit by a NATO missile. Sixteen of her colleagues were killed. She was buried under rubble for hours before being rescued.</p>
<p>The attack drew controversy, as critics argued it violated international law by targeting civilian broadcasters. Matic suffered permanent injuries and never returned to the studio.</p>
