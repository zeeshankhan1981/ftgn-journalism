# Mogadishu, Somalia – 2007

During a U.S.-supported Ethiopian military campaign, Mogadishu was subjected to aerial strikes targeting Islamist insurgents.

Abdirahman Warsame, a university student, was in class when explosions rocked the Bakara Market area. Though his school was not hit, his family’s home was reduced to rubble.

They later joined thousands of internally displaced Somalis in camps outside the city. Years later, Abdirahman became a lawyer advocating for accountability for foreign military actions.
