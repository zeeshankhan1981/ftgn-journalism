  <h1>21 Hue 1968</h1>
  <p><em>1968 — 1968</em></p>
  <article><p># Hue, Vietnam – February 1968</p>
<p>During the Tet Offensive, the ancient city of Hue became a battleground. U.S. Marines launched heavy artillery and aerial assaults to recapture it from North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces.</p>
<p>Nguyen Van Duc was 9 years old when his family's home in Hue’s old quarter was flattened by an airstrike. His father, a schoolteacher, was killed instantly. Duc and his mother fled through shattered alleyways as firefights echoed in the background.</p>
<p>By the time the battle ended, much of Hue’s historic architecture had been reduced to rubble. Over 10,000 civilians died in the battle.</p>
