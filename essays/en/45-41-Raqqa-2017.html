  <p><em>2017 — 2017</em></p>
  <article><p># Raqqa, Syria – 2017</p>
<p>During the battle to retake Raqqa from ISIS, the U.S.-led coalition launched thousands of airstrikes, leaving 80% of the city in ruins.</p>
<p>Faisal Hamoud, a carpenter, returned to Raqqa after the fighting ended. His home was destroyed and four of his neighbors had died in a strike meant for an ISIS commander.</p>
<p>He lived in a tent on the ruins of his house, trying to rebuild with salvaged wood. His story, captured in international news reports, highlighted the human toll of precision warfare in urban zones.</p>
