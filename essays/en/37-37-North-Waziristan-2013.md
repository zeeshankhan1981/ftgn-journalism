# North Waziristan, Pakistan – 2013

In a rare instance, a U.S. drone strike killed a tribal elder just days before he was to lead peace talks with the Pakistani government.

Malik Jalal narrowly escaped the strike, but his driver and bodyguard were killed. Jalal later claimed he had been placed on a U.S. kill list in error.

The incident fueled Pakistani outrage over drone operations and disrupted negotiations with tribal communities.
