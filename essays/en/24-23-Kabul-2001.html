  <h1>23 Kabul 2001</h1>
  <p><em>2001 — 2001</em></p>
  <article><p># Kabul, Afghanistan – October 2001</p>
<p>In response to the September 11 attacks, the U.S. launched Operation Enduring Freedom, beginning with airstrikes on Taliban-controlled Kabul.</p>
<p>Zarmina Gul, a mother of four, lived near a military barracks. When the bombing started, the shockwaves shattered windows and ignited a nearby oil store. Her home caught fire, and she fled with her children through thick smoke.</p>
<p>Gul’s youngest daughter suffered burns, and local hospitals were overwhelmed. Kabul’s infrastructure was fragile; the air campaign exacerbated an already dire humanitarian crisis.</p>
