# Tikrit, Iraq – March 2015

U.S. aircraft supported Iraqi forces retaking Tikrit from ISIS with heavy airstrikes that targeted entrenched militant positions in the city center.

Hussein Ali, a barber, had returned briefly to his shop to collect supplies when the bombing resumed. A nearby ISIS weapons depot exploded, throwing him into a wall. He survived with a broken arm and severe burns.

The city was eventually liberated, but much of the civilian infrastructure was lost. Hussein’s shop, where three generations of his family had worked, was never rebuilt.
