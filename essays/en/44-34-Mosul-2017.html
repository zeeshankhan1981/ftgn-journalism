  <h1>34 Mosul 2017</h1>
  <p><em>2017 — 2017</em></p>
  <article><p># Mosul, Iraq – 2017</p>
<p>The U.S.-backed campaign to liberate Mosul from ISIS involved extensive airstrikes from late 2016 to mid-2017. Residential areas were often caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Nadwa al-Jubouri, a widow with three children, lived in western Mosul. In March 2017, her apartment building was hit by a coalition strike targeting ISIS fighters. Her son was killed instantly, and her leg was crushed.</p>
<p>She was evacuated to a refugee camp and later told her story to humanitarian groups. The U.S. acknowledged civilian casualties but claimed efforts were made to minimize them.</p>
