  <h1>39 Pristina 1999</h1>
  <p><em>1999 — 1999</em></p>
  <article><p># Pristina, Kosovo – 1999</p>
<p>Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, was heavily bombed during NATO’s intervention in the Yugoslav Wars.</p>
<p>Arta Bunjaku, a teenager, sheltered in her school’s basement with dozens of neighbors. When an electricity substation was destroyed, the city was plunged into darkness for days. Her uncle, a mechanic, died when a missile struck a nearby bus station.</p>
<p>After the bombing ended, Arta emerged to find her neighborhood flattened. She later worked with UNHCR as a translator, helping displaced families recount their experiences.</p>
