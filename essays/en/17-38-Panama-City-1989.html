  <h1>38 Panama City 1989</h1>
  <p><em>1989 — 1989</em></p>
  <article><p># Panama City, Panama – December 1989</p>
<p>In Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invaded Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega. The bombing of Panama City began on December 20, 1989.</p>
<p>Maria Teresa Delgado, a seamstress, lived in the El Chorrillo district, which was near the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters. As U.S. AC-130 gunships and F-117s opened fire, her home caught fire. She fled with her elderly mother and spent the night hiding under a bridge.</p>
<p>The bombing destroyed much of El Chorrillo. Human rights groups estimated hundreds of civilians were killed, though exact numbers remain disputed. Maria returned to find her home reduced to ashes.</p>
