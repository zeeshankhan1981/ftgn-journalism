  <h1>05 Baghdad 2003</h1>
  <p><em>2003 — 2003</em></p>
  <article><p># Baghdad, Iraq – March 2003</p>
<p>The “shock and awe” campaign marked the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. On March 20, 2003, Baghdad was blanketed with explosions as over 1,700 air sorties were launched in a single day.</p>
<p>Khalid al-Janabi, a pharmacist, was watching television with his children when the first strike hit a government complex two blocks away. The windows shattered. Fearing for their lives, the family fled to their basement.</p>
<p>Al-Janabi's pharmacy was later destroyed in a fire caused by a misfired missile. He salvaged medicines and distributed them for free in his neighborhood.</p>
