  <h1>08 Basra 1991</h1>
  <p><em>1991 — 1991</em></p>
  <article><p># Basra, Iraq – February 1991</p>
<p>Basra, Iraq’s southern port city, was heavily bombed during the final stages of the Gulf War. The U.S. targeted military units retreating from Kuwait and key infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ali Jassim, a 19-year-old conscript, was stationed near the outskirts when cluster bombs hit his convoy. He survived by diving into a roadside ditch, but dozens of fellow soldiers were killed. Later, he described scenes of devastation—burned-out tanks, dead animals, and oil fires turning the sky black.</p>
<p>Basra’s civilian population endured long-term effects from the war, including contaminated water supplies and chronic health issues tied to the destruction of sanitation systems.</p>
