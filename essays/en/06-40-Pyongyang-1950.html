  <h1>40 Pyongyang 1950</h1>
  <p><em>1950 — 1950</em></p>
  <article><p># Pyongyang, North Korea – 1950–1953</p>
<p>During the Korean War, Pyongyang was subjected to intense aerial bombardment by U.S. forces. In November 1950, the capital was flattened in a series of raids intended to destroy military infrastructure. Survivors describe living in caves and makeshift shelters.</p>
<p>Ri Yong-suk, who was 13 at the time, later recounted in interviews that her family spent nearly two years living underground to avoid U.S. airstrikes. Her brother died of illness due to the lack of food and clean water. Her memory of the war was one of constant displacement, hunger, and fear.</p>
<p>By war’s end, an estimated 75% of Pyongyang had been destroyed. The long-term trauma and devastation helped cement anti-U.S. sentiment in North Korea's national identity.</p>
