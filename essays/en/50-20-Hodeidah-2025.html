  <p><em>2025 — 2025</em></p>
  <article><p># Hodeidah, Yemen – April 8, 2025</p>
<p>In the early hours of April 8, 2025, suspected U.S. airstrikes hit the al-Hawak district of Hodeidah, a critical Red Sea port city.</p>
<p>Fatimah Al-Saqaf, a teacher and mother of three, was preparing breakfast when explosions shook her apartment building. One strike demolished a warehouse across the street, sending shrapnel into nearby homes. Her daughter was injured by glass, and neighbors rushed to dig survivors from the rubble.</p>
<p>The strikes killed at least eight civilians and injured 16, according to Houthi health officials. Local footage showed chaos as ambulances navigated debris-laden streets lit by cellphone flashlights.</p>
