  <h1>18 Hanoi 1965</h1>
  <p><em>1965 — 1965</em></p>
  <article><p># Hanoi, Vietnam – 1965–1972</p>
<p>Nguyen Thi Thanh was 17 when the first wave of U.S. bombers targeted Hanoi in 1965. During “Operation Rolling Thunder,” her school was struck by a 500-pound bomb. She survived by diving beneath her desk, but 12 classmates were killed instantly. Her brother, drafted into local civil defense, helped clear the rubble.</p>
<p>Between 1965 and 1972, Hanoi faced repeated waves of aerial assault. The most intense came in December 1972 during “Operation Linebacker II,” which dropped over 20,000 tons of bombs on the city in just 12 days.</p>
<p>Thanh later became a doctor, treating patients suffering from long-term effects of the bombings, including trauma, burns, and radiation exposure from certain U.S. munitions.</p>
