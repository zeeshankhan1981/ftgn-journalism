# Haiphong, Vietnam – 1972

Bui Van Phu was working at the port of Haiphong when U.S. bombers launched a series of strikes in 1972. One night, a napalm bomb exploded near a warehouse, setting off a chain reaction that engulfed surrounding buildings.

Phu helped evacuate wounded workers and lost two friends in the inferno. After the bombing, he spent weeks removing debris, only to be bombed again days later during another raid.

The U.S. campaign aimed to disrupt North Vietnam’s logistics and shipping, but it severely impacted civilians working in the country’s most critical port city.
