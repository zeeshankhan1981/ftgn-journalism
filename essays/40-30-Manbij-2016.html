<h1>30 Manbij 2016</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2016</em></p>
<p># Manbij, Syria – 2016</p>
<p>Manbij was the site of intense U.S.-led coalition bombing during the campaign to expel ISIS from northern Syria.</p>
<p>Rasha Mahfouz, a teacher, remained in the city to care for her ill father. One afternoon, a bomb struck a residential block next to their home. Her father was killed by falling debris, and Rasha sustained a head injury.</p>
<p>She later gave testimony to human rights groups detailing the indiscriminate nature of the airstrikes. Entire families were buried under collapsed homes as the frontlines shifted rapidly.</p>
