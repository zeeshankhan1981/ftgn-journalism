<h1>22 Jalalabad 2001</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2001</em></p>
<p># Jalalabad, Afghanistan – November 2001</p>
<p>Jalalabad, an eastern Afghan city, was bombed as part of U.S. efforts to flush out al-Qaeda fighters.</p>
<p>Mohammad Younis, a farmer, lost his brother when a U.S. bomb hit a suspected militant hideout near their orchard. The blast leveled the compound and damaged surrounding homes.</p>
<p>In interviews with NGOs, Younis insisted his family had no militant ties. Many locals expressed resentment over indiscriminate bombings, which they believed targeted tribes opposed to the Taliban.</p>
