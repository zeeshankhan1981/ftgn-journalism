<h1>11 Deir Ez Zor 2017</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2017</em></p>
<p># Deir ez-Zor, Syria – 2017</p>
<p>As the Syrian government and U.S.-backed forces closed in on ISIS in Deir ez-Zor, the city was heavily bombarded.</p>
<p>Ahmad Hariri, a vegetable vendor, lost his wife and two sons when a coalition strike hit a bridge they were crossing. He survived only because he had turned back to retrieve his cart.</p>
<p>Ahmad told foreign journalists that no ISIS forces were present at the time—just displaced families trying to flee. His story became part of a broader investigation into civilian casualties during the Deir ez-Zor campaign.</p>
