<p><em>Published: 2020</em></p>
<p># Al Bayda, Yemen – August 2020</p>
<p>U.S. drone strikes targeted alleged AQAP operatives in Al Bayda province. Locals reported civilian casualties, including two boys riding a motorbike.</p>
<p>Fadhl al-Rimi, a schoolteacher, recognized one of the bodies as his student. He said the boys were heading to a village market when the missile struck.</p>
<p>He later testified to human rights groups that no militants were in the area. His school was closed for two weeks in mourning.</p>
