<h1>47 Tabqa 2017</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2017</em></p>
<p># Tabqa, Syria – 2017</p>
<p>The U.S. provided air cover during the Syrian Democratic Forces’ offensive to capture Tabqa from ISIS. Airstrikes were frequent in the lead-up to the dam’s capture.</p>
<p>Nisreen al-Taha, an engineer, was working on a maintenance team at the Euphrates Dam. A strike hit an outer facility, killing several coworkers and damaging key electrical controls.</p>
<p>Fearing a dam collapse, she joined other engineers in stabilizing the structure under fire. Her account appeared in international reports on how infrastructure was imperiled by U.S. bombings.</p>
