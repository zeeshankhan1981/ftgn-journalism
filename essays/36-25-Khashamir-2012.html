<h1>25 Khashamir 2012</h1>
<p><em>Published: 2012</em></p>
<p># Khashamir, Yemen – 2012</p>
<p>On the day of his wedding, Salem bin Ali Jaber, a cleric and vocal opponent of al-Qaeda, was killed in a U.S. drone strike.</p>
<p>He had been summoned to meet suspected militants for a theological debate. As he approached the mosque, a missile struck, killing him and three others.</p>
<p>His cousin, who witnessed the attack, later filed legal complaints in Germany and the U.S., arguing Salem was deliberately targeted despite his anti-extremist views.</p>
