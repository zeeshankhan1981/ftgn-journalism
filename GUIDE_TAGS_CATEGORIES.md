# Managing Tags and Categories in Your Hugo Blog

This guide explains how to use tags and categories for organizing your blog content, and how visitors can browse by topic on your site.

---

## 1. Adding Tags and Categories to Posts

- In your blog post front matter (Markdown or Org), add:
  - `tags: [tag1, tag2]`
  - `categories: [category1, category2]`
- Example (Org-mode front matter):
  ```org
  #+TAGS: emacs orgmode
  #+CATEGORIES: Tools
  ```
- Example (Markdown front matter):
  ```yaml
  tags: [hugo, blogging]
  categories: [Tech]
  ```

## 2. How Hugo Generates Tag/Category Pages

- Hugo automatically creates a page for each tag and category at `/tags/<tag>/` and `/categories/<category>/`.
- It also creates index pages at `/tags/` and `/categories/` listing all terms.
- Each taxonomy page lists all posts with that tag or category.

## 3. Browsing by Tag or Category

- Visitors can click on tags or categories (shown on each post) to see related content.
- The navigation menu can be updated to link to `/tags/` and `/categories/` for easy discovery.

---

## 4. Best Practices

- Use a small, consistent set of categories for broad topics.
- Use tags for specific topics, tools, or themes.
- Avoid duplicate or redundant tags.
