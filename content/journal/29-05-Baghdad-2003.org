The “shock and awe” campaign marked the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. On March 20, 2003, Baghdad was blanketed with explosions as over 1,700 air sorties were launched in a single day.

Khalid al-Janabi, a pharmacist, was watching television with his children when the first strike hit a government complex two blocks away. The windows shattered. Fearing for their lives, the family fled to their basement.

Al-Janabi's pharmacy was later destroyed in a fire caused by a misfired missile. He salvaged medicines and distributed them for free in his neighborhood.
