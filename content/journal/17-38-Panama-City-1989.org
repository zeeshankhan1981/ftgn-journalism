In Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invaded Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega. The bombing of Panama City began on December 20, 1989.

Maria Teresa Delgado, a seamstress, lived in the El Chorrillo district, which was near the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters. As U.S. AC-130 gunships and F-117s opened fire, her home caught fire. She fled with her elderly mother and spent the night hiding under a bridge.

The bombing destroyed much of El Chorrillo. Human rights groups estimated hundreds of civilians were killed, though exact numbers remain disputed. Maria returned to find her home reduced to ashes.
