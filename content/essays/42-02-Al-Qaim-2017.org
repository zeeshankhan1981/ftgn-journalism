Al-Qaim, near the Syrian border, was one of ISIS’s final strongholds. The U.S.-led coalition launched heavy air raids ahead of the Iraqi army’s advance.

Mahmoud al-Salim, a baker, recounted baking bread when a blast shattered his storefront. He woke up in a hospital in Haditha, missing his right hand.

After the battle, he returned to find the neighborhood razed. Many civilians had been unable to evacuate, and their fates remained unrecorded in official tallies.
