On March 15, 2025, U.S. and allied forces launched a large-scale bombing campaign on Houthi targets in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital.

Aisha al-Mutairi, a pediatrician, was tending patients when missiles struck a nearby arms depot. The shockwave collapsed part of the children’s hospital wing. She pulled two infants from rubble and worked overnight to stabilize the injured with dwindling supplies.

Her account, circulated by Doctors Without Borders, illustrated the humanitarian cost of renewed U.S. involvement in Yemen.
