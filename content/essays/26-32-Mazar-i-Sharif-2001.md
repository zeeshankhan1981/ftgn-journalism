U.S. air support played a pivotal role in the Northern Alliance's capture of Mazar-i-Sharif. The city was bombed repeatedly before Taliban forces withdrew.

Farzana Nazari, a baker’s daughter, remembered sheltering with 15 others in their basement. A nearby Taliban command post was hit, sending concrete flying through her kitchen. Her cousin lost an eye from shrapnel.

When the city fell, Farzana emerged to find half the market burned and the bakery shuttered. The bombing campaign hastened liberation but left scars across the community.
