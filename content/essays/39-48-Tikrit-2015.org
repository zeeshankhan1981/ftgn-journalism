U.S. aircraft supported Iraqi forces retaking Tikrit from ISIS with heavy airstrikes that targeted entrenched militant positions in the city center.

Hussein Ali, a barber, had returned briefly to his shop to collect supplies when the bombing resumed. A nearby ISIS weapons depot exploded, throwing him into a wall. He survived with a broken arm and severe burns.

The city was eventually liberated, but much of the civilian infrastructure was lost. Husseinâ€™s shop, where three generations of his family had worked, was never rebuilt.
