During the Tet Offensive, the ancient city of Hue became a battleground. U.S. Marines launched heavy artillery and aerial assaults to recapture it from North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces.

Nguyen Van Duc was 9 years old when his family's home in Hue’s old quarter was flattened by an airstrike. His father, a schoolteacher, was killed instantly. Duc and his mother fled through shattered alleyways as firefights echoed in the background.

By the time the battle ended, much of Hue’s historic architecture had been reduced to rubble. Over 10,000 civilians died in the battle.
