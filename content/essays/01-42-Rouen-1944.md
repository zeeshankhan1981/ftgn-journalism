In April 1944, weeks before D-Day, the U.S. Army Air Forces launched a bombing raid over Rouen aimed at disrupting German logistics. The bombing inadvertently struck several civilian areas.

Jean-Claude Ruel, then a teenager, was caught in the open during the attack. His younger sister was killed instantly by a collapsing wall. Ruel survived by hiding in a ditch but carried shrapnel injuries into adulthood.

The bombing campaign, part of the broader Allied strategy to liberate France, caused significant destruction and civilian casualties in occupied cities like Rouen. While ultimately aiding the defeat of Nazi Germany, these operations left lasting scars among French civilians.
