Saada, a Houthi stronghold, came under intense bombardment in March 2025 as part of a U.S. air campaign.

Hussein Sharaf, a shopkeeper, lost his wife and daughter when their home was struck. He returned from evening prayers to find rubble where his house stood. He later buried his family in the cityâ€™s crowded cemetery, which overflowed with civilian casualties.

Journalists visiting Saada reported entire blocks flattened and a surge in amputations at local hospitals overwhelmed by trauma cases.
