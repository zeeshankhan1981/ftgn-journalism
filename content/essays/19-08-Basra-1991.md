Basra, Iraq’s southern port city, was heavily bombed during the final stages of the Gulf War. The U.S. targeted military units retreating from Kuwait and key infrastructure.

Ali Jassim, a 19-year-old conscript, was stationed near the outskirts when cluster bombs hit his convoy. He survived by diving into a roadside ditch, but dozens of fellow soldiers were killed. Later, he described scenes of devastation—burned-out tanks, dead animals, and oil fires turning the sky black.

Basra’s civilian population endured long-term effects from the war, including contaminated water supplies and chronic health issues tied to the destruction of sanitation systems.
