Jalalabad, an eastern Afghan city, was bombed as part of U.S. efforts to flush out al-Qaeda fighters.

Mohammad Younis, a farmer, lost his brother when a U.S. bomb hit a suspected militant hideout near their orchard. The blast leveled the compound and damaged surrounding homes.

In interviews with NGOs, Younis insisted his family had no militant ties. Many locals expressed resentment over indiscriminate bombings, which they believed targeted tribes opposed to the Taliban.
