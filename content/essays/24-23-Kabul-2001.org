In response to the September 11 attacks, the U.S. launched Operation Enduring Freedom, beginning with airstrikes on Taliban-controlled Kabul.

Zarmina Gul, a mother of four, lived near a military barracks. When the bombing started, the shockwaves shattered windows and ignited a nearby oil store. Her home caught fire, and she fled with her children through thick smoke.

Gul’s youngest daughter suffered burns, and local hospitals were overwhelmed. Kabul’s infrastructure was fragile; the air campaign exacerbated an already dire humanitarian crisis.
