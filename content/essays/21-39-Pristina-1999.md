Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, was heavily bombed during NATO’s intervention in the Yugoslav Wars.

Arta Bunjaku, a teenager, sheltered in her school’s basement with dozens of neighbors. When an electricity substation was destroyed, the city was plunged into darkness for days. Her uncle, a mechanic, died when a missile struck a nearby bus station.

After the bombing ended, Arta emerged to find her neighborhood flattened. She later worked with UNHCR as a translator, helping displaced families recount their experiences.
