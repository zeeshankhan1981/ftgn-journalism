During a U.S.-supported Ethiopian military campaign, Mogadishu was subjected to aerial strikes targeting Islamist insurgents.

Abdirahman Warsame, a university student, was in class when explosions rocked the Bakara Market area. Though his school was not hit, his familyâ€™s home was reduced to rubble.

They later joined thousands of internally displaced Somalis in camps outside the city. Years later, Abdirahman became a lawyer advocating for accountability for foreign military actions.
