The U.S.-backed campaign to liberate Mosul from ISIS involved extensive airstrikes from late 2016 to mid-2017. Residential areas were often caught in the crossfire.

Nadwa al-Jubouri, a widow with three children, lived in western Mosul. In March 2017, her apartment building was hit by a coalition strike targeting ISIS fighters. Her son was killed instantly, and her leg was crushed.

She was evacuated to a refugee camp and later told her story to humanitarian groups. The U.S. acknowledged civilian casualties but claimed efforts were made to minimize them.
