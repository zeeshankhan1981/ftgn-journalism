Fallujah saw two major battles between U.S. forces and insurgents. In November 2004, the U.S. launched Operation Phantom Fury, deploying heavy artillery, airstrikes, and white phosphorus.

Samar al-Dulaimi, a teacher, remained in the city with her disabled father. During the bombing, their home collapsed. Trapped for 12 hours under the rubble, she was rescued by neighbors but her father did not survive.

Much of the city was flattened. Over 800 civilians were killed, and more than half the population displaced. Fallujah became a symbol of urban warfare's cost to civilians.
