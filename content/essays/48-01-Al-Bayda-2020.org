U.S. drone strikes targeted alleged AQAP operatives in Al Bayda province. Locals reported civilian casualties, including two boys riding a motorbike.

Fadhl al-Rimi, a schoolteacher, recognized one of the bodies as his student. He said the boys were heading to a village market when the missile struck.

He later testified to human rights groups that no militants were in the area. His school was closed for two weeks in mourning.
