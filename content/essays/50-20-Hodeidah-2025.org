In the early hours of April 8, 2025, suspected U.S. airstrikes hit the al-Hawak district of Hodeidah, a critical Red Sea port city.

Fatimah Al-Saqaf, a teacher and mother of three, was preparing breakfast when explosions shook her apartment building. One strike demolished a warehouse across the street, sending shrapnel into nearby homes. Her daughter was injured by glass, and neighbors rushed to dig survivors from the rubble.

The strikes killed at least eight civilians and injured 16, according to Houthi health officials. Local footage showed chaos as ambulances navigated debris-laden streets lit by cellphone flashlights.
