On the day of his wedding, Salem bin Ali Jaber, a cleric and vocal opponent of al-Qaeda, was killed in a U.S. drone strike.

He had been summoned to meet suspected militants for a theological debate. As he approached the mosque, a missile struck, killing him and three others.

His cousin, who witnessed the attack, later filed legal complaints in Germany and the U.S., arguing Salem was deliberately targeted despite his anti-extremist views.
