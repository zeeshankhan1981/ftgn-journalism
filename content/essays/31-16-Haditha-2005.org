While not an aerial bombardment, the Haditha killings followed a roadside bombing that led U.S. Marines to storm civilian homes.

Yassir Walid, 10, hid under his bed when his parents and sister were shot in their living room. He was the only survivor in his household. 

His account helped trigger a major investigation and eventually a congressional inquiry into rules of engagement.
