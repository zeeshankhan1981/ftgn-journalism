Pham Quang Huy was a porter for the South Vietnamese army stationed near the Khe Sanh combat base when the siege began. U.S. forces dropped more than 100,000 tons of bombs in 77 days—the equivalent of five Hiroshima-level bombs.

Huy lost hearing in one ear after a B-52 strike landed too close to his position. He witnessed entire hillsides collapse from the force of the bombardment and saw comrades buried alive in trenches.

The siege became a symbol of American airpower—but also of its limits.
