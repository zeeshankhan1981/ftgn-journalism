During the battle to retake Raqqa from ISIS, the U.S.-led coalition launched thousands of airstrikes, leaving 80% of the city in ruins.

Faisal Hamoud, a carpenter, returned to Raqqa after the fighting ended. His home was destroyed and four of his neighbors had died in a strike meant for an ISIS commander.

He lived in a tent on the ruins of his house, trying to rebuild with salvaged wood. His story, captured in international news reports, highlighted the human toll of precision warfare in urban zones.
