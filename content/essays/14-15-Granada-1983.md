During the U.S. invasion of Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury), airstrikes targeted key facilities held by the Marxist government.

David Charles, a university janitor, was inside the campus when U.S. aircraft struck the perimeter. Though not directly targeted, the blasts shattered dorm windows and caused several injuries. David helped evacuate wounded students from the rubble.

The operation lasted just days but left lasting political and social consequences. Locals like Charles remained haunted by the sudden eruption of war on their island.
