Alongside Tripoli, Benghazi was bombed by U.S. forces during Operation El Dorado Canyon. Airstrikes targeted military barracks and communications hubs.

Salem Qaddafi, a night guard at a municipal warehouse, was injured when a blast shattered glass doors and ignited a fuel tank nearby. He recalled running from the building as flames consumed adjacent blocks.

The attack shocked the Libyan population and drew condemnation from several international allies, sparking protests across North Africa.
