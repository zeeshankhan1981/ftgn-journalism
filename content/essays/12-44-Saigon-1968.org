During the 1968 Tet Offensive, U.S. forces conducted aerial and artillery bombardments within Saigon to push back insurgents. 

Trinh Thi Lan, a nurse working in Cho Ray Hospital, described the chaos as shells landed near the hospital grounds. The maternity ward was evacuated, and Lan helped move newborns into underground shelters. 

Although U.S. firepower ultimately repelled the offensive, many neighborhoods were damaged in the crossfire. Lan later testified to international reporters about the trauma inflicted on patients and hospital staff alike.
