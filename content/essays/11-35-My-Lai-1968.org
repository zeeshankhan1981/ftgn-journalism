Although not a traditional bombing campaign, My Lai was the site of one of the Vietnam War’s worst atrocities. U.S. troops, under the command of Lt. William Calley, massacred over 500 unarmed civilians. 

Do Ba, 10 years old, hid in a ditch with his younger sister. He watched soldiers execute his neighbors at close range. A helicopter crew—Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson and his gunners—landed amid the chaos and stopped further killings by threatening their fellow Americans.

Do Ba survived and later testified before Vietnamese and foreign investigators.
